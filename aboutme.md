I'm currently working for SambaSafety. They aggregate 
and I analyse. My projects have ranged from deep association analysis
to creating an ingestion pipleline for NOAA weather data. Most days
I'm neck deep in SQL or R.

My hobbies include <a href="https://benhoffman.net/mountain_biking">mountain biking</a>,
the occasional walk with my <a href="https://benhoffman.net/cat">cat</a>,
and reading.

I've mountain biked all across Colorado. Even completed a self supported several day bike packing trip.
My favorite terrain is challenging technical. I had the amazing opportunity to
mountain bike in Peru with trails starting at 14,500 ft. It was experience that made me realize
how much I've progressed as a mountain biker.
