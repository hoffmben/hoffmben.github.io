My hobbies include <a href="https://benhoffman.net/mountain_biking">mountain biking</a>,

I've mountain biked all across Colorado. Even completed a self supported several day bike packing trip.
My favorite terrain is challenging technical. I had the amazing opportunity to
mountain bike in Peru with trails starting at 14,500 ft. It was experience that made me realize
how much I've progressed as a mountain biker.
