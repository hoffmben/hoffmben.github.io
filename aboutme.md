I'm currently working for the data consultancy, Data Clymer. My focus has been
on providing scalabe and event based ELT solutions using PySpark, AWS, AWS Lambda, and
terraform. I work with clients to ensure the solutions are cost effective across the whole
ELT pipeline from infrustructure to pipeline development. Certified in Databricks and Matillion.

My hobbies include <a href="https://benhoffman.net/backpacking">backpacking</a>,
the occasional walk with my <a href="https://benhoffman.net/cat">cat</a>,
and reading.
<br>
Backpacking has been my major passion lately. I find the resourcefulness and both mental and physical endurance backpacking requires thrilling! It's provided so many amazing moments and challenges to overcome it's become a major source of personal developmemt and enjoyment. One of the most simple and 
impactful moments was cracking a bottle cap and having to adapt my entire days plans.

With my day to day more data engineering and less analysis, my language of choice has moved to Python.
I still root for R and believe it's dataframe implementation is far more pleasant than Pandas, but a general
purpose language for ETL it is not. I'm currently especially skilled in event based pipelines using Python,
AWS, terraform, and Docker.
<br>
My research topics have moved strongly towards open source LLMs. I believe these hold substantial promise 
for democratizing AI. Currently focused on the SDLC and productizing of LLMs.

I volunteer regularly as a way to share the joys in my life. After adopting my first cat in 2018
I've been a regular volunteer for <a href="https://www.rmfr-colorado.org/">RMFR</a>. I generally help with
transporting kittens and working events like Taste of Colorado. 
<br>
I also pitch in for various mountain biking causes. Sometimes this helping
with trail work, other times, this has been patrolling the trails handing out
water and giving directions.
