I'm currently working for SambaSafety. They aggregate 
and I analyse. My projects have ranged from deep association analysis
to creating an ingestion pipleline for NOAA weather data. Most days
I'm neck deep in SQL or R.

My hobbies include <a href="https://benhoffman.net/mountain_biking">mountain biking</a>,
the occasional walk with my <a href="https://benhoffman.net/cat">cat</a>,
and reading.
