<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> 
I'm currently working for SambaSafety. They aggregate 
and I analyse. My projects have ranged from deep association analysis
to creating an ingestion pipleline for NOAA weather data. Most days
I'm neck deep in SQL or R.

My hobbies include <a href="https://benhoffman.net/mountain_biking">mountain biking</a>,
the occasional walk with my <a href="https://benhoffman.net/cat">cat</a>,
and reading.
<br>
I've mountain biked all across Colorado. Even completed a self supported several day bike packing trip.
My favorite terrain is challenging technical. I had the amazing opportunity to
mountain bike in Peru with trails starting at 14,500 ft. It was experience that made me realize
how much I've progressed as a mountain biker.

<li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-university" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
Graduated from the University of Colorado Denver with a degree in Mathematics.
I additionally hold two minors; Physics and Computer Science. My mathematics
emphasis is in applied mathematics namely statistics.

My favorite language to code in is R. There's so many great libraries and tools
that allow me to think analysis and audience first it's become my language of choice
for many projects. Lately, I've been exploring the potential of 
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
for dependancy management and scaling data science web apps.

I volunteer regularly as a way to share the joys in my life. After adopting my first cat in 2018
I've been a regular volunteer for <a href="https://www.rmfr-colorado.org/">RMFR</a>. I generally help with
transporting kittens and working events like Taste of Colorado. 
<br>
I also pitch in for various mountain biking causes. Sometimes this helping
with trail work, other times, this has been patrolling the trails handing out
water and giving directions.
